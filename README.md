Snake Game Overview

Snake Game is a classic single-player game where a snake moves around a board. The snake grows longer by eating food randomly placed on the board. The main objectives are to avoid colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's own body, which ends the game.

Game Rules
Boundary Collision: If the snake moves out of the game board's boundaries, the game ends.
Self-Collision: If the snake collides with its own body, the game ends.
Prerequisites
To implement the Snake Game, you need:

HTML: Define the structure of the game board.
CSS: Style the game board and elements.
JavaScript: Implement game logic such as snake movement, food placement, collision detection, and game state management.
Implementation Approach
HTML Structure: Create a game board using HTML, possibly a <div> with a specified size.
CSS Styling: Use CSS to define the appearance of the game board, snake, food, and any other visual elements.
JavaScript Logic:
Initialize the game board size, snake initial position, and other game parameters.
Manage snake movement based on user input (keyboard controls).
Randomly place food on the board.
Update the snake's position and length when it eats food.
Detect collisions with boundaries or the snake's own body to end the game.
Implement game loop using setInterval() to update game state and render changes.
