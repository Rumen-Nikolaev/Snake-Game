# Snake Game

## Overview

The Snake Game is a classic single-player game where a snake moves around a board. The objective is to eat food randomly placed on the board, which makes the snake grow longer. Players must avoid colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

## Game Rules

- **Boundary Collision**: If the snake moves out of the game board's boundaries, the game ends.
- **Self-Collision**: If the snake collides with its own body, the game ends.

## Prerequisites

To implement the Snake Game, you need:

- **HTML**: To define the structure of the game board.
- **CSS**: To style the game board and its elements.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the game logic, including snake movement, food placement, collision detection, and game state management.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. HTML Structure
- Create a game board using HTML, possibly a `<div>` with a specified size to represent the playing area.

### 2. CSS Styling
- Use CSS to define the appearance of the game board, snake, food, and any other visual elements.

### 3. JavaScript Logic
- Initialize the game board size, the snake's initial position, and other game parameters.
- Manage snake movement based on user input (keyboard controls).
- Randomly place food on the board.
- Update the snake's position and length when it eats food.
- Detect collisions with boundaries or the snake's own body to end the game.
- Implement a game loop using `setInterval()` to update the game state and render changes.

## Repository Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the game.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the game board and elements.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
3. Try to eat the food while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
4. Enjoy the game!

## Conclusion
The Snake Game provides a fun and engaging way to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It enhances programming skills through game development while offering a nostalgic gaming experience.
